# Options API

API mod that allows developers to add their own settings to some of the settings menus in game.

## This mod has little to none of it's own features. If you didn't download this with a mod that uses it, this mod will not do anything.

If you are looking for a mod that does use this API (with a similar logo), check out [MoreLevelOptions](mod:ninxout.more_level_options)
